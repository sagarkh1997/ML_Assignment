    "# Part 1 - Predicting Review Scores on Pitchfork\n",
    "\n",
    "For Part 1, we will be using data from [this paper](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/ICWSM/article/view/7355). The data is a collection of reviews from [Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/), a site that provides expert reviews of music album. The authors of this paper have also combined the data with a set of features from [Spotify’s API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) that provide insight into the music itself, e.g. the \"acousticness\" of the song.  We will tackle a regression problem here, trying to predict the score of a review from several of the other columns in the dataset.\n",

    "## Part 1.1 - Feature Engineering with Feature Subsets\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first subsection of Part 1, we’re going to rely on our old friend linear regression. We’re going to look at how running linear regression with various subsets of our features impacts our ability to predict score.\n",

    "- All models should be trained on the dataset `part1_train.csv`. \n",
    "- For each of these trained models, you should evaluate the model’s predictions on the training dataset, as well as the provided test set, called `part1_test.csv`. The evaluation metric we will use is **root mean squared error**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Write out the result to a file called `part_1.1_results.csv` and submit this along with your assignment. The file should have the following columns:\n",
    "- `feature_set` - a column describing the features of the model used. For feature sets with multiple features, combine them using an underscore (you can do this with the code `\"_\".join(feature_set)`)\n",
    "- `training_rmse` - a column that gives the RMSE of a linear regression model trained on this feature set on the training data\n",
    "- `test_rmse` - a column that gives the RMSE of a linear regression model trained on this feature set on the test data\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, please answer the following questions:\n",
    "- **1.1.1** Which model had the best RMSE on the *training data*? \n",
    "- **1.1.2** Which model had the best RMSE on the *test data*? \n",
    "- **1.1.3** Which feature do you believe was the most important one? Why? *(Note: There is more than one perfectly acceptable way to answer this question)*\n",

You should use the [LassoCV](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LassoCV.html) class in `sklearn`, it will do the cross-validation necessary to select the appropriate value for the regularizer for you!  Use 10-fold cross-validation to perform model selection (set the `LassoCV` parmaeter `cv` to 10), and set the `random_state` to 1. Do not change any of the other parameters to `LassoCV` (i.e. leave them at their defaults).\n",
